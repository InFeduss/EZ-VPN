# EZ-VPN
quality of life script for VPN users (HTB, TryHackMe)
you will need to set the FULL path of the file the first time,
so a conf file will be created.

in order to use the script from anywhere in the terminal use the following
command : mv VPN.sh /usr/local/bin/VPN

feel free to use and change the script as you like :D
